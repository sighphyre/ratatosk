### Chore

 - <csr-id-adba9eb58cfd347510f821f00aa32c078001a332/> formatting for sanity

### Other

 - <csr-id-f7a78affaca1b549a07c16c073dad96612affc0b/> stable pattern to building and executing rules but this is a checkpoint so I can experiment
 - <csr-id-ae1d91cc92d0b419eb288d4e33f929a7dac51f4a/> build execution tree and then execute it, pulling out meta data as we go - we can get the entire description of why the toggle is what it is
 - <csr-id-7f390731b7a3fc47e4bad0e8b8c4bc24f2dfb1db/> still very hack but build an execution tree from fragments of the parse result, should allow us to walk this with contexts
